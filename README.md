# C---Memory-Allocation-Algorithms
A C program to simulate memory allocation algorithms

See Group5projectDoc for more detail.

OVERVIEW
Our teamâ€™s task was to successfully simulate memory allocation algorithms. For
our project we used the first fit, best fit, worst fit and next fit memory allocation
algorithms. While running these algorithms we compared the performance of each
algorithm and analyzed their differences.
